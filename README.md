# AgentUX Framework

**AgentUX** is a design discipline and compliance framework for building dual-mode interfaces optimized for both human users and AI agents.

As AI systems increasingly interpret and interact with digital interfaces, the need for machine-readable, ethically structured, and semantically rich design patterns has become essential. AgentUX introduces a forward-looking approach to interface design—one that ensures both human usability and agent interpretability.
