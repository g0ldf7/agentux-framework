# AgentUX Framework

**AgentUX** is a design discipline and compliance framework for building dual-mode interfaces that are optimized for both human users and AI agents.

As AI systems increasingly consume and interpret digital interfaces, the need for machine-readable, ethically-structured, and semantically-rich design patterns has become critical. AgentUX introduces a forward-looking approach to interface design—one that ensures both human usability and agent interpretability.
